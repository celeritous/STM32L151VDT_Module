# STM32L151VDT_Module
This repository is for an STM32L151/152 Cortex M3 32bit low power ARM  processor module. The design supports any of the STM32L151 or 152 processors in the QFP100 package. It is designed primarily for battery powered applications. 

The design is in KiCad and is released under the CERN OHL Ver 1.2 It is on a 50mm x 50mm 4 layer PCB with two 38 Pin dual row 100mil headers for user power and IO. There is no on-board voltage regulation so the user must supply regulated 1.8V-3.3V power to the board. Voltages in excess of this may damage the board. The board may operate as low as 1.65V but not all peripherals will operate at this voltage and full clock speed maynot be supported. The processor is capable of internal cclock speeds of up to 32MHz. 

Features include a USB FS port that can function as host or client as well as and optional uSD card slot and ESP-07 serial WiFi Module. The uSD card slot and WiFi module may be independently powered down by the processor to reduce power consumption. 

Along with the hardware design, the repository also contains a sample STM32CubeMX pin assignemt project file and a sample Atollic TrueStudio project file generated by the STM32CubeMX project file.
